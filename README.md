### Hi there 👋, I am Richard Okonicha.

 > * Spaceships hop from my qwerty keys,
 > * If you look more closely, I promise you would see.
 > * When linted they swing as they float as they would do so in space,
 > * I have tried and tried but just can't keep these colors in place,
 > * I hope I'm paid to do what I ❤️ 
 > * else I would do it anyway.
 > * For the love of software and community, 
 > * my GitHub says it all.
